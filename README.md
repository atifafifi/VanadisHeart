Vanadis Hearth: Recipe Management App

Welcome to Vanadis Hearth, your personal sanctuary for finding, managing, and preserving culinary treasures. This project is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, with data persistence managed by Firebase Firestore.

The current application is focused on a responsive, orange-themed frontend shell, ready for the core logic integration.

âœ… Next Steps for Development

Our immediate focus is integrating the backend to make the app functional:

Firebase Initialization: Integrate the global __firebase_config and __initial_auth_token into App.tsx to establish the connection and authenticate the user.

Firestore Logic: Implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the "My Recipes" view, storing private data in the user's Firestore path.

TheMealDB Integration: Implement the public API calls for the "Discover" view to fetch external recipe data.
